Solidus Signifyd
================

Integration with Signifyd that implements a fraud check prior to marking a
shipment as ready to be shipped.

Installation
------------

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "solidus_signifyd"
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_signifyd:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to
building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy
app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
